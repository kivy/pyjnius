Welcome to Pyjnius
==================

Welcome to Pyjnius's documentation. This documentation is divided into
different parts. We recommend that you get started with :ref:`installation`,
and then head over to the :ref:`quickstart`. You can also check :ref:`android`
for specific example for the Android platform.  If you'd rather dive into the
internals of Pyjnius, check out the :ref:`api` documentation.
