Welcome to PyJNIus
==================

PyJNIus is a `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ library for accessing
`Java <https://www.java.com/>`_ classes using the
`Java Native Interface <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jni/>`
(JNI).

It either starts a new `Java Virtual machine <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/vm/java-virtual-machine-technology-overview.html>`_
(JVM) inside the process, or retrieves the already surrounding JVM (for example on Android).

PyJNIus is managed by the `Kivy Team <https://kivy.org/about.html>`_ and can be
used with `python-for-android <https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android>`_.

PyJNIus is released and distributed under the terms of the MIT license. You should have received a
copy of the MIT license alongside your Kivy distribution. Our
`latest license <https://github.com/kivy/kivy/blob/master/LICENSE>`_
is also available.


This documentation is divided into differents parts. We recommend you to start
with :ref:`installation`, and then head over to the :ref:`quickstart`. You can
also check :ref:`android` for specific example for the Android platform.  If
you'd rather dive into the internals of PyJNIus, check out the :ref:`api`
documentation.
