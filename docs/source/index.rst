Welcome to Pyjnius
==================

Pyjnius is a Python library for accessing Java classes.

It either starts a new JVM inside the process, or retrieves the already surrounding JVM (for example on Android).

This documentation is divided into differents parts. We recommend you to start
with :ref:`installation`, and then head over to the :ref:`quickstart`. You can
also check :ref:`android` for specific example for the Android platform.  If
you'd rather dive into the internals of Pyjnius, check out the :ref:`api`
documentation.
